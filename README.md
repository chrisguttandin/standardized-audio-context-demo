This is a little demo page to show how to use [standardized-audio-context](https://github.com/chrisguttandin/standardized-audio-context). To see it in action please go to [chrisguttandin.github.io/standardized-audio-context-demo](https://chrisguttandin.github.io/standardized-audio-context-demo).

## Usage

To work with the example locally a fairly recent version Node.js and npm is needed. Once you have the project cloned all other dependencies can be install by running `npm ci`.

To play around with the code locally `grunt monitor` can be used to spin up a local server which listen to port 8811.

This is so far a very minimal demo. Please feel free to file an issue an case you are missing something.
